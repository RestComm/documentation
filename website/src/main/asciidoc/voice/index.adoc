= Overview

Restcomm allows to easily build fast, reliable and secure voice applications that let you make, manage, route and scale calls to a browser or any phone.

* Programmatically make and receive voice calls in your application. Using this REST API, you can make outgoing calls, modify calls in progress, and query metadata about calls

* Build apps that scale with the web technologies that you are already using.

* Bring personalized call experiences to your customers quickly with the help of our handy drag and drop Visual Designer.

* Restcomm enables you to stay in control of call quality in bringing your own carrier.

* Quickly interconnect any existing Voice system and handle advanced call control or call transfer with Restcomm.

* Record and store inbound or outbound calls

* Create and manage conference calls

* Send text-to-speech messages

* Integrate speech recognition that translates audio-to-text


== API Reference

=== Base URL

All URLs referenced in the documentation have the following base:

`\https://cloud.restcomm.com/restcomm/2012-04-24`

The Restcomm RESTful APIs are served over HTTPS. To ensure data privacy, unencrypted HTTP is not supported.

== RCML

=== Overview
RCML is a set of instructions you can use to tell Restcomm what to do when you receive an incoming call or SMS.

When someone makes a call to one of your Restcomm numbers, Restcomm will look up the URL associated with that phone number and make a request to that URL. Restcomm will read RCML instructions at that URL to determine what to do: record the call, play a message for the caller, prompt the caller to press digits on their keypad, etc.

RCML is similar to HTML. Only one RCML document is rendered to the caller at once, but many documents can be linked together to build complex interactive SMS applications.

=== Restcomm's request to your application

Restcomm makes HTTP requests to your application just like a regular web browser, in the format *application/x-www-form-urlencoded*. By including parameters and values in its requests, Restcomm sends data to your application that you can act upon before responding.

You can configure the URLs and HTTP Methods Restcomm uses to make its requests via your account portal or using the REST API.

When Restcomm receives a message for one of your Restcomm numbers, it makes a synchronous HTTP request to the message URL configured for that number and expects to receive RCML in response.

Restcomm sends the following parameters with its request as POST parameters or URL query parameters, depending on which HTTP method you've configured:
