=== Concepts 

There is multiple ways to interact with {product} to build communications applications

* Use <<connect/rvd/index.adoc#RVD,{product} Visual Designer (RVD)>> to build applications easily with drag and drop without knowing anything about programming

* The <<connect/api/index.adoc#API,{product} API>> allows you to query meta-data about your account, applications, phone numbers, calls, SMS, and recordings. You can also do some communications control like initiate outbound calls and send SMS messages.

* The <<connect/rcml/index.adoc#RCML,{product} Markup Language>> is a set of instructions you can use to tell {product} what to do when you receive an incoming call or SMS.

* The <<connect/sdks/index.adoc#SDKs,{product} Web, iOS and Android SDKs - Preview>> allows you to embed Communications as a feature in your Web, iOS and Android Native Applications

* The <<connect/tutorials/index.adoc#tutorials,{product} Tutorials>> will help you in creating sample applications that cover common use cases in a variety of languages using the {product} API, {rcml} or Visual Designer. Download, test, and tweak for yourself.
