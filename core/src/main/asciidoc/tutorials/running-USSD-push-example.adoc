= Restcomm USSD Simulator - Notify

image:http://documentation.telestax.com/core/ussd/images/Restcomm-ussd-simulator_Notify.png[Restcomm USSD Simulator - Notify]

You can simulate a simple Notify dialog by following the below steps:

* Fill the ISDN field with a preferred ISDN number, for example "1111" is good for SS7 Simulator. Now press "Apply changes".
* Perform "reset" operation.
* Perform "sendNotify" operation with parameters: String=<Text of your notification>, boolean=false, int=60000 and String=<any random string>. Parameters definition is as below
+
** 1st String is USSD message that you want to push to mobile
** 2nd Boolean if set to true means USSD Gw will send empty TCAP Begin and try to establish dialog before sending actual message.
** 3rd Int is custom invoke timeout. User must respond within this period else USSD Gw will terminate Dialog and Application will get appropriate error message
** 4th String is random string that is stored at USSD Gw side as custom object. When ever response comes back, USSD Gw will include this custom string in XML Payload.
* Perform "close" operation.

You will now find a notification at the SS7 Simulator. 

You can also simulate more complicated scenarios like pushing the tree based menu to user and expecting some input from users by calling `sendRequest`. The below Class provides more explanation for attributes and operations of HttpPush.

[[running-the-shell]]
Running the Shell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must start the Shell client and connect to the managed instance prior to executing commands to configure the Gateway. Shell can be started by issuing the following command from `restcomm-ussdgateway-3.0.13/jboss-5.1.0.GA/bin` directory:

[source,lang:default,decode:true]
----
[$] ./ss7-cli.sh
----

Once console starts, it will print following information and await further commands:

[source,lang:default,decode:true]
----
version=2.0.0-SNAPSHOT,name=restcomm CLI,prefix=restcomm,vendor=TeleStax
restcomm>
----

Before issuing further commands you must connect to a managed instance. For more details on connecting to an instance and for a list of all supported commands and details on configuring the SS7 stack refer to the Restcomm SS7 Stack User Guide.

[[authentication]]
Authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

RestcommUSSD Gateway GUI Management Security is based on the JBoss Security Framework. However please note that the feature is not fully functional yet and you will not be able to sign-out or sign-in using the login panel at the top right corner of the GUI. Future releases will offer a full implementation. 

As of now, there is basic authentication offered (which is based on the JBoss Security framework). When you try to start the Web Console, you will be prompted to enter login credentials. These credentials can be configured in the files `jmx-console-roles.properties` and `jmx-console-users.properties` located at `restcomm-ussdgateway-<version>/jboss-5.1.0.GA/server/<profile>/conf/props/`. 

You can also change the authentication from flat file system to database by making necessary configurations in the file `restcomm-ussdgateway-<version>/jboss-5.1.0.GA/server/<profile>/conf/login-config.xml`. 

For detailed instructions and to know more about JBoss Security Framework please refer to the JBoss Installation Guide http://docs.jboss.org/jbossas/docs/Installation_And_Getting_Started_Guide/5/html_single/index.html#Basic_Configuration_Issues-Security_Service[here].

NOTE: Default user-id and password for GUI Management Console is admin and admin. You can change the user-id and password in files jmx-console-roles.properties andjmx-console-users.properties located atrestcomm-ussdgateway-/jboss-5.1.0.GA/server//conf/props/
