[[pre-requisite]]
= Pre-requisite:

* You must have Restcomm USSD Gateway installed as explained in the Installation Guide.
* If you are using the SS7 board on server, you must ensure that the `java.library.path` variable is set to point to the directory containing the native component. Alternatively you can copy it to the JBoss native library path manually.

[[step-1---start-the-ussd-server]]
= Step 1 - Start the USSD Server

* Go to **$USSD_GATEWAY_HOME`/jboss-5.1.0.GA/bin`**.
* ./run.sh -b LOCAL_SERVER_IP -c simulator

= Step 3 - Start the jSS7 Simulator and send traffic to the USSD Gateway

* Go to the directory *$USSD_GATEWAY_HOME`/jboss-5.1.0.GA/tools/`*
* Add executable mode to the ./run.sh
* start the jss7 simulator
* *chmod +x run.sh*
* Start the jSS7 Simulator
* * `./run.sh gui`*
* In the GUI select "main" (default) as host name [or type "win" as host name under Windows] and press the 'Start' button.
* Press 'Run test' and again click on 'Start' in the next screen.
*  To test under Windows OS, you must change the SS7 simulator settings to TCP.
