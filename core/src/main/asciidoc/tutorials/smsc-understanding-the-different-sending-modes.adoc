Restcomm SMSC has 4 different sending modes

* Datagram
* Transactional
* Forward and Store (FAS)
* Store and Forward (SAF)

= Datagram

Incoming messages will be immediately sent to a destination without being stored in the database.

= Transactional

This is similar to datagram mentioned above, however, a return message (success or failure) will be sent to the originator.

NOTE: *Datagramm* and *Transactional* have only one message delivery attempt. If message delivery fails, no further attempt will be made to resend the message therefore, the message will be dropped

= Forward and Store (FAS):

In this mode, an immediate delivery is performed. If the attempt fails, the message will be stored into a database and then, periodic attempts at sending the message will be performed.

= Store and Forward (SAF):

In this mode, the message will be stored in the database and then, periodic attempts at sending the message will be performed
